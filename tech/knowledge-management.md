## Def

[wiki] [Knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) - A **knowledge base** (**KB**) is a technology used to [store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_storage) complex [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data) and [unstructured information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_information) used by a computer system. The initial use of the term was in connection with [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_systems); which were the first [knowledge-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems).

[wiki] [Knowledge-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems) - A **knowledge-based system** (**KBS**) is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that [reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning) and uses a [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) to [solve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) [complex problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems). The term is broad and refers to many different kinds of systems. The one common theme that unites all knowledge based systems is an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly and a [reasoning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_system) that allows it to derive new knowledge. Thus, a knowledge-based system has two distinguishing features: a [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) and an [inference engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine).

[wiki] [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management_software) - **Knowledge management software** (**KM software**) is a subset of [Enterprise content management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_content_management) software, which contains a range of software that specializes in the way information is collected, stored and/or accessed. The concept of [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) is based on a range of practices used by an [individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual), a [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business), or a large [corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) to identify, create, represent and redistribute [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) for a range of purposes. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called [information management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_management) software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) software.
